Controller methods file, where the models are used and their information is server to routes or tests.


> count method

Helper testing function to count all IDs


> list method

Helper testing function to list all IDs


> add method

Add a description and a data to our model - rollback and return False if anything goes wrong (PK not respected, for example)


> remove method

Remove a descriptor from an ID on our model - rollback and return False if anything goes wrong (register not found, for example)


> remove_all method

Remove a list of descriptors from a single ID on our model - rollback and return False if anything goes wrong (any register not found, for example)


> grab_descriptors_values_to_diff method

Grab all the descriptors values to diff or get out


> grab_pairs_keys_to_compare method

Grab all pair of keys to compare




> find_diff_indexes_and_lenght_on_same_size_values method

Find the diff indexes and lenght of the difference, as follows below, and return on an array of diffs. Some more details follows below:

(a) on the first different char in a sequence, save that index on a buffer along with the sequence lenght (only 1 for now)

(b) on the successive different chars in a sequence, increment the lenght of the sequence on the buffer

(c) on the first equal char after a sequence of differences, add the buffer to our list and reset it if needed


> diff_values method

Compute insights on where the diffs are and their lenght on strings with the same size (without using https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html)

* Initialize returned struct in the format: {"size":"equal", "diffs":[]}
* Doesn't compare different size strings
* Save the diffs obtained go to diffs entry

> diff method

Calculates the difference on values of all the pairs of descriptors to diff from a given ID

* Grab the values to diff - if all the values are not present on that ID, return None
* Grab the key pairs to compare - if no pair is given or found, return None
* For each pair, calculate the diff between their components values

# to hold the ID table

*Obtained from file:* [SuperDiffer/id/models.py](https://github.com/gpaOliveira/SuperDiffer/blob/master/SuperDiffer/id/models.py)

Model class to hold the ID table (Primary Key), along with its descriptors (Primary Keys also, so we don't want to have non-unique descriptors to a ID) and value

Routes to allow clients to add left and right base64 encoded on JSON values and fetch their diff

> [**GET /v1/diff/<int:id>**] diff_right_left method

Calculates the diff between left and right descriptors of a given ID and remove those descriptors if they're found (even if the data lenght is not the same and no diff is made)

> [**POST /v1/diff/<int:id>/right**] add_right_to_id method

Add a JSON base64 value (in the format: {"data":"base64value"}) to the right descriptor of a given ID
